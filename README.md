# LSF Clip Viewer

LSF Cip viewer is a tool I built that fetches all the newest clip from the subreddit /r/livestreamfails and display them all in a youtube-style format

## Motivation

I wanted to have a place where I can watch all the newest clips in one tab without having open and close a new tab to view each clip

## Tech/framework used

Built with:

- [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)
- [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

## Launching the Server

To launch the application, please run the following command from the project root folder:

`npm start`

## Screenshots

Users are prompted a video player and a list of the clips to choose from
